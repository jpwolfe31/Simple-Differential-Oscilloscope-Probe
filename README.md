Simple Differential Oscilloscope Probe

I was working on a core memory demonstration board and thought it would be helpful if I had a differential probe to measure the currents through the cores.  I did not want to spend $120 on a mediocre product and thought I could use the $5 chip in the mediocre product with stuff I already had to make my own (actually three).  It worked well for my needs and thought I should put it out there for others.  Schematic and photos in the repository.
